## leetcode - 72. Edit Distance
https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/
### problem
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """

        l1=len(word1)
        l2=len(word2)
        dp=[[0]*(l2+1) for _ in range(l1+1)] 

        for i in range(l1+1):
            dp[i][0]=i

        for j in range(l2+1):
            dp[0][j]=j

        for i in range(1, l1+1):
            for j in range(1, l2+1):

                if word1[i-1]==word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j]=min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])+1

        
        return dp[-1][-1]
                
```
