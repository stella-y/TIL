## leetcode - 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/
### problem
```
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```
### solution 1
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        people=sorted(people, key=lambda p:(p[0],p[1]))

        ans=[[-1,-1]]*len(people)

        for h,k in people:
            cnt=0
            i=0
            while cnt<k:
                if ans[i][0]<0 or ans[i][0]==h:
                    cnt+=1
                i+=1
            for j in range(i, len(ans)):
                if ans[j][0]<0:
                    ans[j]=[h,k]
                    break

        return ans
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        people=sorted(people, key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        ans=[]
        for h,k in people:
            ans.insert(k, [h,k])
        return ans
