## leetcode - 62. Unique Paths
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
### problem
```
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```
### solution
- dp
```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        grid=[[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i==0 and j==0:
                    grid[i][j]=1
                if i-1>=0 and j-1>=0:
                    grid[i][j]=grid[i-1][j]+ grid[i][j-1]
                elif j-1>=0:
                    grid[i][j]=grid[i][j-1]
                elif i-1>=0:
                    grid[i][j]=grid[i-1][j]
                    
        return grid[m-1][n-1]
