## leetcode - Perform String Shifts
https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3299/
### problem
```
You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:

direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift). 
amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation: 
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:  
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def stringShift(self, s, shift):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type shift: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: str
        """
        i=0
        for d, a in shift:
            if d==0:
                i=(i+a)%len(s)
            else:
                i=(i-a)%len(s)
        return s[i:]+s[:i]
