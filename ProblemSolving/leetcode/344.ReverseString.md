## leetcode - 344. Reverse String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
### problem
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(len(s)/2):
            tmp=s[i]
            s[i]=s[len(s)-i-1]
            s[len(s)-1-i]=tmp
```
