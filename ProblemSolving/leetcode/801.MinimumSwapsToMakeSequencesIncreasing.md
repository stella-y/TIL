## leetcode - 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/
### problem
```
We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minSwap(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        N=len(A)
        swap=N*[N]
        not_swap=N*[N]
        swap[0]=1
        not_swap[0]=0
        for i in range(1, N):
            if A[i-1]<A[i] and B[i-1]<B[i]:
                swap[i]=swap[i-1]+1
                not_swap[i]=not_swap[i-1]
            
            if A[i-1]<B[i] and B[i-1]<A[i]:
                swap[i]=min(swap[i], not_swap[i-1]+1)
                not_swap[i]=min(not_swap[i], swap[i-1])
                
        return min(swap[-1], not_swap[-1])
```
