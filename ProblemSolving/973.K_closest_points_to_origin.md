## leetcode - k cloest points to origin
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
### problem
```
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```
### solution
```python
import math
class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, K):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        dist_dict={}
        for idx, v in enumerate(points):
            dist=v[0]*v[0]+v[1]*v[1]
            dist_dict[idx]=dist
        
        sorted_dict=sorted(dist_dict, key=lambda i : dist_dict[i])
        ans=[]
        for i in range(K):
            ans.append(points[sorted_dict[i]])
            print(ans)
        return ans
```

        points.sort(key=lambda P: P[0]**2+P[1]**2)
        return points[:K]
