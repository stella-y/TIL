## leetcode - 142. Linked List Cycle II
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
### problem
```
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```
### solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        slow=head
        fast=head
        cycle=False

        while fast and fast.next and fast.next.next:
            fast=fast.next.next
            slow=slow.next
            if fast==slow:
                cycle=True
                break
        if cycle==False:
            return None
        
        while head!=fast:
            head=head.next
            fast=fast.next
        return head
```
